# SysML2 Modeling Standard

## Required Standards

Read these standards first before applying this standard:

- **`software-items.md`** - Software categorization (System/Subsystem/Unit/OTS/Shared Package)
- **`design-documentation.md`** - Design document structure that embeds the diagrams this
  standard produces

## Purpose

The repository's software structure is modeled in SysML2 under `docs/sysml2/` rather than
hand-maintained as prose or an ASCII tree. The model is the authoritative, machine-queryable
source of structure; rendered diagrams and `docs/design/introduction.md`'s narrative are
generated/derived artifacts. AI agents should query the model (see `sysml2tools-query`
skill) before deep-diving into source code to understand what a piece of the system is,
why it exists, and what it depends on.

## Repository Structure

```

`docs/sysml2/common/software-items.sysml` defines the `SoftwareItemMetadata::SoftwareInfo`
`metadata def` used by every System/Subsystem/Unit for artifact-location traceability (see
Artifact-Location Metadata below). It is intentionally self-contained (no repo-specific
imports) so it can be copied/synced verbatim across repositories without modification — do not
edit it beyond keeping it in sync with the canonical version.

`docs/sysml2/model/` mirrors the same folder shape as `docs/design/`, `docs/reqstream/`, and
`docs/verification/` — one `.sysml` file per System/Subsystem/Unit, at the same nesting depth
as that item's companion design/requirements/verification files. This keeps each file small
and keeps PRs that touch one unit's model from producing unrelated diffs in unrelated units.
`docs/sysml2/views/` is a sibling of `model/`, not nested inside it, so a single
`docs/sysml2/model/**/*.sysml` glob never needs to exclude view files (`sysml2tools` has no
exclude-glob syntax).

There is no separate "stable entry point" file — a repository may contain multiple systems,
so no single alias name would generalize. Agents discover the system(s) present by running
`query list --kind "part def"` or `query find` (see the `sysml2tools-query` skill) over
`docs/sysml2/**/*.sysml`, not by assuming a fixed name.

Always pass the full set of `.sysml` files (or an equivalent glob) to every `sysml2tools`
invocation — the model spans multiple files and cross-references between them; files sharing
the same `package Name { ... }` merge into one namespace automatically with no `import`
required, as long as all files are passed together. As of `sysml2tools` 0.1.0-beta.5,
`lint` and `render` both expand `*`/`**` glob patterns internally (recursing correctly into
subdirectories), so pass a single **quoted** glob string (e.g. `'docs/sysml2/**/*.sysml'`)
and let the tool resolve it — do not rely on the shell to expand it, and do not quote-strip
the pattern before it reaches the tool. Quoting keeps the behavior identical across
PowerShell and bash, since neither shell needs to (or reliably does) expand `**` itself.

## Model Content

- `{system-name}.sysml` defines one `part def` for the System only, with `part` usages
  referencing its direct Subsystems/Units (defined in their own files, see below).
- Each `{subsystem-name}.sysml` / `{unit-name}.sysml` defines exactly one `part def`, with a
  `doc /* ... */` comment stating its purpose — mirroring what would otherwise be written as
  prose in `docs/design/introduction.md`'s Software Structure section. The standard SysML v2
  `doc` comment is the single purpose statement for every System/Subsystem/Unit/OTS `part def`;
  do not duplicate it in metadata. Subsystem files add
  `part` usages for their own direct children (nested subsystems or units), matching the
  Software Item Hierarchy in `software-items.md`.
- `ots.sysml` / `shared.sysml` define one `part def` per OTS item / Shared Package, referenced
  as `part` usages from the system(s) that depend on them.

## Artifact-Location Metadata

Every System/Subsystem/Unit `part def` records where its companion artifacts live, as a single
applied `metadata info : SoftwareInfo { ... }` annotation, using the shared `SoftwareInfo`
`metadata def` from `docs/sysml2/common/software-items.sysml` (see Repository Structure above).
As of `sysml2tools` 0.1.0-beta.13+, applied metadata attribute values are fully surfaced by
`sysml2tools query describe` (in both Markdown and JSON output) as `Metadata
SoftwareInfo.{attribute}: {value}` summary lines — one call gets every artifact location for a
unit without grepping the source tree. (Prior to beta.13, `query describe` silently dropped
metadata attribute values entirely; this is why an earlier version of this standard recommended
`comment` elements instead — that workaround is no longer needed and should not be used in new
work.) `SoftwareInfo` carries artifact locations only — the purpose statement lives solely in
the `doc` comment (shown by `query describe` as the `Documentation:` line). Metadata
annotations have zero effect on rendered diagrams.

```sysml
private import SoftwareItemMetadata::*;

part def {UnitName} {
    doc /* One-line purpose statement. */

    metadata info : SoftwareInfo {
        sourceFiles = ("{path to the unit's source file}");
        testFiles = ("{path to the unit's test file}");
        designFiles = ("{path to the unit's design doc}");
        verificationFiles = ("{path to the unit's verification doc}");
        requirementFiles = ("{path to the unit's reqstream file}");
    }
}
```

Every `sourceFiles`/`testFiles`/`designFiles`/`verificationFiles`/`requirementFiles` attribute is
`String [0..*]` (a list), so multiple files can be listed per attribute when applicable; omit an
attribute entirely (do not assign an empty list) when it does not apply to the item:

- **Systems and Subsystems** have no `sourceFiles` (no single source file represents a whole
  system or subsystem) — set `testFiles` to the subsystem-level test file when one exists.
- **Units without a dedicated companion doc** (e.g. small data-model types documented inline
  within their subsystem's design doc rather than in their own file) point `designFiles` /
  `verificationFiles` / `requirementFiles` at the subsystem-level doc, with a short parenthetical
  note in the `doc` comment, e.g. `/* ... (documented as a supporting value type in the subsystem
  doc). */`.
- **Units without a dedicated test file** (exercised only indirectly through another unit's
  tests) omit `testFiles` entirely rather than pointing at an unrelated test file.
- **OTS items** have no `sourceFiles`/`testFiles` (no local integration code); set `designFiles`
  (when the optional design doc exists) / `verificationFiles` / `requirementFiles` only.

This is prose-searchable metadata only — it is not a substitute for the authoritative
requirements/design/verification artifacts, and it does not replace ReqStream as the
requirements source of truth. (This repository currently keeps requirements traceability in
ReqStream; a future migration to native SysML2 `requirement`/`satisfy` modeling is a separate,
not-yet-scheduled change.)

## Dependency Relationships

- Model "who uses what" as `dependency A to B;` statements, declared in the file of the
  **Unit that owns the outgoing dependency** (`from` is optional) — never centralized in a
  shared file, never at the Subsystem level (subsystems are pure containers with no code).
- Add a one-line comment above each unit's dependency block stating *why*, not just *what*.
- Source each Unit's dependency list from that Unit's own design doc, not a Subsystem-level
  summary diagram (which may omit real edges, e.g. re-entrant calls).
- Consume dependencies by **querying**, not by rendering a dedicated diagram: `sysml2tools query
  uses`/`used-by`/`dependencies --element {QualifiedName}` return every `dependency` edge (in
  addition to structural typing/containment references) directly from the model — see the
  `sysml2tools-query` skill. Do not declare a dedicated `DependencyView`/
  `{SubsystemName}DependencyView` diagram for this purpose: `render asInterconnectionDiagram`
  ignores `dependency` edges entirely (only renders `connect`), and an earlier `asGeneralDiagram`-
  based dependency-diagram approach was abandoned as unmaintainable at scale (unreadable/clipped
  canvases once a system has more than a handful of cross-unit dependencies). Model `dependency`
  statements purely as queryable facts, never as a rendering target.

## Attribute Modeling

- Add `attribute` declarations to Units whose C# type carries real data fields (records,
  DTOs, config objects), sourced directly from the C# properties/record parameters. Import
  scalar types from `ScalarValues` (`String`, `Integer`, `Boolean`, etc.). For a C# `enum`,
  declare a matching SysML2 `enum def`. Leave pure-behavior Units as empty `part def`s.
- SysML2 has no map/dictionary attribute type. For a `Dictionary<TKey,TValue>`-shaped
  field, split it into a parallel `{name}_key`/`{name}_value` attribute pair (underscore,
  not hyphen — bare identifiers disallow hyphens), with a comment stating the key
  semantics. If `TValue` is itself a modeled Unit, use a `part {name} : {ValueUnit} [0..*];`
  composition instead of an attribute pair, with the same kind of keying comment.

## Views (`docs/sysml2/views/design-views.sysml`)

Views control what gets rendered into diagrams for the design document. Use named `view`
**usages** (not `view def` **definitions**) — `expose` is only valid inside a usage:

```sysml
package {SystemName} {
    private import StandardViewDefinitions::*;

    view SoftwareStructureView : InterconnectionView {
        expose {SystemName}::**;     // all members, recursively: system + subsystems + units
    }

    view {SystemName}View {
        expose {SystemName}System;   // system def only, not expanded into subsystems
    }

    view {SubsystemName}View {
        expose {SubsystemName};      // one subsystem def only
    }
}
```

Type `SoftwareStructureView` by a standard view definition from the SysML v2 Views library
(`GeneralView`, `InterconnectionView`, ...; requires `sysml2tools` 0.3.0-beta.3+). The view
definition selects the diagram notation; `InterconnectionView` draws the system as nested
containment boxes, which is the clearest full-detail overview for a single system.

**Critical distinction** (do not confuse these — this cost significant trial-and-error to
discover): `expose <name>;` is what scopes a rendered diagram's content (the union of the
named element's containment subtree). The view definition (or a `render <kind>;` member)
selects a rendering *style* — it has **no effect on scope**. `expose` is only legal inside a named
`view Name { ... }` **usage**; it is a syntax/semantic error inside a `view def Name { ... }`
**definition**. `expose` targets must be `::`-qualified or locally-resolvable names, not
dotted member-access chains (`expose foo.bar;` is invalid — use `expose Bar;`).

**Exposing a package needs a membership wildcard.** `expose {Package};` exposes only the
package element itself, which renders as an empty package symbol. To show what a package
contains, expose its members: `expose {Package}::*;` (direct members) or
`expose {Package}::**;` (recursively). Exposing a `part def` by name (as `{SystemName}View`
and `{SubsystemName}View` do) is fine: its own parts are its structure.

**Naming convention** — one `View` suffix per rendered diagram, no `System`/`Subsystem`
suffix duplication:

- `SoftwareStructureView` - full detail: every system, subsystem, and unit in one diagram
- `{SystemName}View` - one per system, direct members only (not expanded into subsystems)
- `{SubsystemName}View` - one per subsystem (at any nesting depth), that subsystem's own
  members only

There is no dedicated `DependencyView`/`{SubsystemName}DependencyView` diagram convention —
`dependency` relationships are consumed via `sysml2tools query` (see Dependency Relationships
above), not rendered.

When a repository has multiple systems, type `SoftwareStructureView` by `GeneralView`,
expose each system package's members, and filter out documentation so the overview stays
readable — the general view draws one package frame per system, while an interconnection
view places all systems in a single row:

```sysml
package {RepoName}DesignViews {
    private import StandardViewDefinitions::*;

    view SoftwareStructureView : GeneralView {
        expose {SystemNameA}::**;
        expose {SystemNameB}::**;
        filter not @SysML::Documentation;
    }
}
```

Documentation (`doc`) is exposed with its owner and drawn as a `doc` compartment unless a
view filters it out; use `filter not @SysML::Documentation;` wherever doc text would clutter
a diagram.

## Diagram Embedding

Render with quoted recursive globs for the shared metadata definition and the model tree, plus the views file
(`sysml2tools` 0.1.0-beta.5+ expands and recurses `**` internally, so no shell-side globbing
or explicit per-file listing is needed):

```pwsh
dotnet sysml2tools render `
  --output docs/design/generated --format svg `
  'docs/sysml2/common/**/*.sysml' `
  'docs/sysml2/model/**/*.sysml' `
  'docs/sysml2/views/design-views.sysml'
```

With multiple views declared and no `--view` flag, `sysml2tools` renders every declared view
in one invocation, one file per view, using each view's own name as the filename
(`{ViewName}.svg`) — no post-render rename step is needed.

Embed diagrams in `docs/design/` per this rule: every design doc for an item embeds the
diagram for the narrowest view that still shows that item's own immediate structure —

- `docs/design/introduction.md` — `SoftwareStructureView.svg` (the full-detail overview)
- `docs/design/{system-name}.md` and every unit doc for a unit directly under the system
  (no subsystem parent) — `{SystemName}View.svg`
- `docs/design/{system-name}/{subsystem-name}.md` and every unit doc nested under that
  subsystem (at any depth) — `{SubsystemName}View.svg`

Place the image directly under the file's top-level heading, before its first prose
subsection, e.g. `![{Name} Structure]({ViewName}.svg)`.

Document dependencies in prose instead of a diagram: each System/Subsystem design doc's
"Dependencies" section should be generated/maintained from `sysml2tools query dependencies
--element {QualifiedName}` output (Markdown format), not an embedded image.

## Build and Lint Integration

- `sysml2tools lint` belongs in `lint.ps1`'s compliance-tools section, **not** as a separate
  step in the CI design-document job — `lint.ps1` gates every later job (including document
  generation) transitively, so linting the model there is both earlier and non-duplicated.
  Pass a single quoted recursive glob, e.g. `dotnet sysml2tools lint 'docs/sysml2/**/*.sysml'`
  — `sysml2tools` (0.1.0-beta.5+) expands and recurses this itself, so no
  `Get-ChildItem`/shell-side globbing is needed.
- The CI design-document job renders the views (see the render command above) before running
  Pandoc, so generated SVGs exist before HTML generation. Rename/stable-filename workarounds
  are unnecessary since view names are stable by definition. Pass the common, model, and views globs as
  separate quoted arguments (e.g. `'docs/sysml2/common/**/*.sysml' 'docs/sysml2/model/**/*.sysml' 'docs/sysml2/views/design-views.sysml'`)
  — plain PowerShell (the default shell) is sufficient; no `shell: bash`/`shopt -s globstar`
  workaround is needed.
- Add `sysml2tools` to `.config/dotnet-tools.json` (`demaconsulting.sysml2tools.tool`) and to
  `.versionmark.yaml`'s captured tool list.

## Fallback

If the model is stale, doesn't yet cover an item, or a query returns nothing useful, fall
back to `grep`/`glob`/reading source directly. When work adds or changes a Unit/Subsystem,
update the corresponding `.sysml` model file in the same change — this mirrors the existing
requirement to keep `docs/design/*.md` and `docs/reqstream/*.yaml` companion artifacts in
sync.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Every System/Subsystem/Unit in `docs/design/introduction.md` has a matching `part def`
  in its own file under `docs/sysml2/model/`, at the same folder depth as its companion
  design/reqstream/verification files, with a purpose `doc` comment
- [ ] Every Unit-level `part def` applies a `metadata info : SoftwareInfo { ... }` annotation
  with `sourceFiles`/`testFiles`/`designFiles`/`verificationFiles`/`requirementFiles` set where
  applicable (see Artifact-Location Metadata for documented exceptions); System/Subsystem
  `part def`s set `testFiles`/`designFiles`/`verificationFiles`/`requirementFiles` but no
  `sourceFiles`; the purpose statement appears only in the `doc` comment, never in `SoftwareInfo`
- [ ] `docs/sysml2/views/design-views.sysml` uses `view Name { expose ...; }` usages, not
  `view def` definitions
- [ ] View names follow the `SoftwareStructureView` / `{SystemName}View` /
  `{SubsystemName}View` convention (no dedicated `DependencyView`)
- [ ] Each Unit's real collaborators are captured as `dependency A to B;` statements, and each
  System/Subsystem design doc's "Dependencies" section reflects `sysml2tools query
  dependencies` output rather than an embedded diagram
- [ ] `sysml2tools lint` passes on all `.sysml` files
- [ ] Rendered diagrams are embedded in every design doc per the Diagram Embedding rule
- [ ] `sysml2tools` is present in `lint.ps1`, `.config/dotnet-tools.json`, and
  `.versionmark.yaml`
